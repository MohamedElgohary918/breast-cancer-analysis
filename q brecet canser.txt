Q1: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. Display the first 10 rows and check for missing values.
Q2: Clean the dataset by handling any missing values or duplicates.
Q3: Convert categorical variables like "Diagnosis" (Benign or Malignant) into numeric values using appropriate encoding.
Q4: Check the correlation between numeric features like mean_radius, mean_texture, and the target variable "Diagnosis".
Q5: What are the distribution patterns for numeric variables like mean_radius, mean_texture?
Q6 check outliers and handle it 

Classification Models
Q7: Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split().
Q8:Build and evaluate a Logistic Regression / Decision Tree /  Random Forest model

Q9: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
